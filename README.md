# Battery and Bumper Display

This project is adapted to be used with the HCS12 microcontroller.

## Requirements 
CodeWarrior
HCS12 Microcontroller

## Description

A program that reads the potentiometer and shows the equivalent battery voltage reading on the LCD. The same program should read the bumper switches and put
symbols on the LCD to indicate whether the bumper switches are open or closed. A blank character is shown if the switch is open and, a letter (B for Bow, S for Stern for example) when the switch is closed.

The pdf file is a detailed guide of this project.

Enjoy! And please do let me know if you have any comments, constructive criticism, and/or bug reports.
